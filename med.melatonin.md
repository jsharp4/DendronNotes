Hormone naturally produced by brain to control sleep. Spikes at night due to lessened light intake (explains why staring at blue light at night makes it hard to sleep).

## Optimize natural melatonin

To naturally produce more melatonin, look at sunlight in the morning, and limit light intake at night.

## Supplemental melatonin
Recommended to take 1-3 mg 2 hours before bedtime ([[src|https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/melatonin-for-sleep-does-it-work#:~:text=Use%20melatonin%20sleep%20supplements%20wisely%20and%20safely.&text=Take%201%20to%203%20milligrams,few%20days%20before%20your%20trip.]])

but, looks like most otc capsules are 5/10 mg
