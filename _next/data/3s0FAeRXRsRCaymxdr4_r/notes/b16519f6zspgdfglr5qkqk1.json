He defines a machine as a digital discrete state machine (mostly for convenience, as he'd already proved that these machines are universal computers provided sufficient storage in <a href=\"/notes/7immu8tggfrrc82gymrrybw\">On Computable Numbers</a>). He suggests that a thinking being should act indistinguishably from a human, as humans are the only entities which undisputably think.</p>\n<p>Using these working definitions, Turing rephrases his question to the following: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Is it true that by modifying this computer to have an adequate\nstorage, suitably increasing its speed of action, and providing it with an appropriate programme, C can be made to play satisfactorily the part of A in the imitation game, the part of B being taken by a man?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The paper does little more from than suggest that we try it, and speculate that a device with 10<sup>9</sup> <a href=\"/notes/ukdapjyewuptx8bpbf9zvxs\">Storage Capacity</a> could play tha game effectively. In the rest of the paper, Turing discusses edge-cases of the game mechanics to silence stupid naysayers, and breaks down key arguments against the validity of the game (i.e. that the game is pointless because, surely, machines could never think):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>God gave only humans a soul, but not to machines</li>\n<li>Thinking machines would be scary, so they cannot exist.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/notes/atudcs83gr1aqsajgmg7chu\">Godel's Theorem</a> proved that there are questions which discrete state machines cannot answer, and so asking these questions would easily win the game.</li>\n<li>\"Thinking\" only comes from consciousness, i.e. that knowing thinking was done.</li>\n<li>Machines just can't do some things, like enjoy strawberries and cream.</li>\n<li>Machines cannot learn. They do only what they are programmed to learn.</li>\n<li>Discrete state machines are discrete. The human nervous system is continuous.</li>\n<li>Machines cannot be programmed, regardless of storage capacity, to match the behavior of a human in every instance, because humans follow internal laws of conduct (judgement) that cannot be rigorously described.</li>\n<li>Machines can't win the game in cases of human E.S.P. or telepathy.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Counter-arguments 3, 6, and 7 are interesting. The rest are idiotic. Counter-counter arguments:</p>\n<p>(3) Every machine has questions which it cannot answer, but those questions vary from machine to machine. How can we guess which questions the machine doesn't know to provide it is not human?</p>\n<p>(6) Machines can learn if programmed to learn by modifying their own instruction storage.</p>\n<p>(7) Turing concedes that this is true, but unlikely to impede the machine from playing the game competitively.</p>\n<h1 id=\"noteworthy-ideas\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#noteworthy-ideas\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Noteworthy Ideas</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Turing is funny <a class=\"color-tag\" style=\"--tag-color: #20c073;\" href=\"/notes/o7z7o919o4d2iq3cda5iutp\">#qq</a> get quotes.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Turing stresses that we use discrete machines only for convenience here, and also use electronic machines for convenience.
