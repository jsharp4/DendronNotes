tech hub in Cape Town?\n* How would African governments win/lose?\n\n## Desperados Waiting for a Train\nAccount of digital and military technology pushing the Old West frontier off the edge of the map past San Francisco, and eventually even from the Southwest in Austin. The old frontier was replaced by the digital, but has to continued to progress geographically. \n\n### Key topics\n* Contrast between civil war and WWI/WWII technology - we see industrial technology taken seriously early 21st century\n* Digital frontier was destined to move west when [[ppl.von_neumann]] left Princeton for UCLA.\n* Move from SF to Boulder, Austin, and Bozeman\n* Still resistance to digital advancement in the U.S. - when will tech take the south?\n   * Ole Bubs - find article on fiber internet by Cory Doctorouw\n\n### Objective Wars\nTrend of marketed and for-profit science since WWII. Commentary on how science and its products are incorrectly viewed as pure today.

Comparison of hardware vs. people-managing techniques, treatment of people as a resource, and the rise of remote work in tech.\n\n## Shaking the Bee Hive\nProgrammers and computer scientists have little understanding of the world they build, and are unable to produce products without defects. We can't even write simple programs without issue, much less enterprise systems, machine learning, or quantum computing. A \"bug\" is a clever piece of marketing to mask incompetence. Understating the complex and unweildy nature of the systems built by software engineers may be perilous.\n\n### Key ideas\n* Random success of tech as in [[ref.chaos_monkeys]] and the Hardware Lottery (need to cite).\n* Complex systems like code reviews, unit/integration/load tests, IDEs, and patches don't keep out defects.\n* Complex systems are inherently broken as in [[ref.complex_systems]]\n* Disentanglement in machine learning doesn't work.\n* Quantum computing is another animal entirely.\n* The internet is built for performance - no delivery or security guarantees. The rest of the digital world is the same\n* Humans can't track more than three/four variables without losing accuracy (need to cite).\n\n## The Sorcerer, the Sage, and the Site Reliability Engineer\nTrends of science fiction predicting technological advancements. Trends of fantasy magic seeking what electrical engineers have created in the modern world. Highlights of goofy computer pioneers such as [[ppl.claude_shannon]], [[ppl.feynman]], [[ppl.von_neumann]], and [[ppl.alan_turing]] taking life by funny angles. Highlights of authors such as H.G.

not a book about [[ppl.alan_turing]]. While set in his era, and even intersects with rough location when he visited the United States and met with [[ppl.claude_shannon]] to discuss the theory of computing, the book is about his contemporaries at the [[pl.ias]] and the computers which were built to instantiate the universal computing machine.\n\n# Noteworthy Ideas\n* The [[pl.ias]] was not originally planned to be at [[pl.princeton]]. Princeton leadership lobbied hard for locations nearby the campus, and continued to spend large sums on expansion nearby.\n#qq Who was the leader of Princeton at this time, and who became the leader of IAS?\n\n* The [[pl.ias]] benefitted greatly from German hostility towards Jews near the onset of WWII. Hungarian [[ppl.von_neumann]], German [[ppl.einstein]], Austrian [[ppl.kurt_godel]], and Polish [[ppl.stan_ulam]] all fled Europe to make significant contributions to computing in the United States. The [[pl.ias]] was willing to jump through hoops, lie about teaching positions (in Godel's case), and invest significant funds to facilitate immigration.\n\n* [[ppl.von_neumann]] was likely the most significant figure to computer engineering in history. He contributed heavily to the designs of the [[computers.eniac]], [[computers.edvac]], [[computers.maniac]], along with applications in meteorology, the atomic bomb, and the [[math.monte_carlo]]. He consulted for the U.S. military, at [[pl.los_alamos]], [[companies.IBM]], [[companies.rca]], and served as department head at the [[pl.ias]].\n\n* [[ppl.von_neumann]] was a genius, known for making jumbled ideas of other clear. Also quirky, he frequently bought and totalled Cadillacs, and lost his lisence for speeding (quote: \"Because they wouldn't sell me a tank\"). He had great interest in [[math.game_theory]] (which he more or less invented) and gambling.\n\n","n":0.059}}},{"i":76,"$":{"0":{"v":"The Information","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n\n| Author | Publish Year | Publisher | Accessed | Link |\n| :-------: | :------------:|:------------:|:------:| :---: |\n| [[ppl.james_gleick]] | 2011 | [[pub.rha]] | Audio | [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/The-Information-James-Gleick-audiobook-dp-B004Q3NKK4/dp/B004Q3NKK4/ref=mt_other?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=1650239337)\n\n## Full Title: \nThe Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood\n\n# Summary\n\n# Noteworthy Ideas\n\n# Direct Quotes\n","n":0.156}}},{"i":77,"$":{"0":{"v":"Taking Nazi Technology","n":0.577},"1":{"v":"\n\n| Author | Publish Year | Publisher | Accessed | Link |\n| :-------: | :------------:|:------------:|:------:| :---: |\n| [[ppl.douglas_m_oreagan]] | 2019 | [[pub.jhup]] | E-book | [Amazon]([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07KM6SR11/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1))\n\n## Full title\nTaking Nazi Technology: Allied Exploitation of German Science after the Second World War\n\n# Summary\n\n# Noteworthy Ideas\n\n# Direct Quotes\n","n":0.149}}},{"i":78,"$":{"0":{"v":"Seveneves","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n\n| Author | Publish Year | Publisher | Accessed | Link |\n| :-------: | :------------:|:------------:|:------:| :---: |\n| [[ppl.neil_stephensen]] | 2015 | [[pub.morrow]] | Audio | [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Seveneves-Novel-Neal-Stephenson-ebook/dp/B00LZWV8JO/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=seveneves&qid=1650241738&sprefix=sevene%2Caps%2C133&sr=8-1) |\n\n# Summary\n\n# Noteworthy Ideas\n\n# Direct Quotes\n","n":0.177}}},{"i":79,"$":{"0":{"v":"On Computable Numbers","n":0.577},"1":{"v":"\n\n| Author | Publish Year | Publisher | Accessed | Link |\n| :-------: | :------------:|:------------:|:------:| :---: |\n| [[ppl.alan_turing]]| 1936 | [[pub.london_math_society]] | PDF | https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/Turing_Paper_1936.pdf |\n\n# Summary\n\n# Noteworthy Ideas\n\n# Direct Quotes\n","n":0.18}}},{"i":80,"$":{"0":{"v":"A Mind at Play","n":0.5},"1":{"v":"\n\n| Author | Publish Year | Publisher | Accessed | Link |\n| :-------: | :------------:|:------------:|:------:| :---: |\n| [[ppl.jimmy_soni]], [[ppl.rob_goodman]] | 2017 | [[pub.ss]] | Audio | [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Play-Shannon-Invented-Information-ebook/dp/B01M5IJN1P/ref=sr_1_4?crid=3AGENPKSPO1DE&keywords=claude+shannon&qid=1650239936&sprefix=claude+shanno%2Caps%2C137&sr=8-4) \n\n## Full title\nA Mind at Play: How Claude Shannon Invented the Information Age\n\n# Summary\n\n# Noteworthy Ideas\n\n# Direct Quotes\n","n":0.149}}},{"i":81,"$":{"0":{"v":"The Hard Thing About Hard Things","n":0.408},"1":{"v":"\n\n| Author | Publish Year | Publisher | Accessed | Link |\n| :-------: | :------------:|:------------:|:------:| :---: |\n| [[ppl.ben_horowitz]]| 2014 | [[pub.harper]] | Audio | [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Hard-Thing-About-Hard-Things-audiobook/dp/B00I0A6HUO/ref=tmm_aud_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1650241532&sr=8-1) |\n\n## Full title\nThe Hard Thing About Hard Things: Building a Business When There Are No Easy Answers\n\n# Summary\n\n# Noteworthy Ideas\n\n# Direct Quotes\n","n":0.146}}},{"i":82,"$":{"0":{"v":"What Do You Care What Other People Think?","n":0.354},"1":{"v":"\n\n| Author | Publish Year | Publisher | Accessed | Link |\n| :-------: | :------------:|:------------:|:------:| :---: |\n| [[ppl.feynman]] | 1988 | [[pub.norton]] | Audio | [OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com/?id=ffb86e766ae46438%210%2AL0xpdmVGb2xkZXJzL0RvY3VtZW50cy9GZXlubWFuL1doYXRfRG9fWW91X0NhcmVfV2hhdF9PdGhlcl9QZW9wbGVfVGhpbms&cid=FFB86E766AE46438) |\n\n## Full title\n\nWhat Do You Care What Other People Think: Further Adventures of a Curious Character\n\n# Summary\n\n# Noteworthy Ideas\n\n# Direct Quotes\n","n":0.146}}},{"i":83,"$":{"0":{"v":"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\n\n| Author | Publish Year | Publisher | Accessed | Link |\n| :-------: | :------------:|:------------:|:------:| :---: |\n| [[ppl.feynman]] | 1998 | [[pub.blackstone]] | Audio | [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Surely-Youre-Joking-Mr-Feynman/dp/B00005458Z/ref=tmm_aud_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1650240705&sr=8-1) |\n\n## Full title\nSurely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman: Adventures of a Curious Character\n\n# Summary\n\n# Noteworthy Ideas\n\n# Direct Quotes\n","n":0.152}}},{"i":84,"$":{"0":{"v":"Computing Machinery and Intelligence","n":0.5},"1":{"v":"\n\n| Author | Publish Year | Publisher | Accessed | Link |\n| :-------: | :------------:|:------------:|:------:| :---: |\n| [[ppl.alan_turing]]| 1950 | [[pub.mind]] | PDF | https://academic.oup.com/mind/article/LIX/236/433/986238 |\n\n# Summary\nTuring argues that the question \"Can machines think?\" is important, but is ill-defined as neither \"think\" nor \"machine\" has clear meaning. He defines a machine as a digital discrete state machine (mostly for convenience, as he'd already proved that these machines are universal computers provided sufficient storage in [[ref.on_computable_numbers]]). He suggests that a thinking being should act indistinguishably from a human, as humans are the only entities which undisputably think.\n\nUsing these working definitions, Turing rephrases his question to the following: \n\n> Is it true that by modifying this computer to have an adequate\nstorage, suitably increasing its speed of action, and providing it with an appropriate programme, C can be made to play satisfactorily the part of A in the imitation game, the part of B being taken by a man?\n\nThe paper does little more from than suggest that we try it, and speculate that a device with 10<sup>9</sup> [[math.comp.storage_capacity]] could play tha game effectively. In the rest of the paper, Turing discusses edge-cases of the game mechanics to silence stupid naysayers, and breaks down key arguments against the validity of the game (i.e. that the game is pointless because, surely, machines could never think):\n\n1. God gave only humans a soul, but not to machines\n2. Thinking machines would be scary, so they cannot exist.\n3. [[math.comp.godels_theorem]] proved that there are questions which discrete state machines cannot answer, and so asking these questions would easily win the game.\n4. \"Thinking\" only comes from consciousness, i.e. that knowing thinking was done.\n5. Machines just can't do some things, like enjoy strawberries and cream.\n6. Machines cannot learn. They do only what they are programmed to learn.\n7. Discrete state machines are discrete. The human nervous system is continuous.\n8. Machines cannot be programmed, regardless of storage capacity, to match the behavior of a human in every instance, because humans follow internal laws of conduct (judgement) that cannot be rigorously described.\n9. Machines can't win the game in cases of human E.S.P. or telepathy.\n\nCounter-arguments 3, 6, and 7 are interesting. The rest are idiotic. Counter-counter arguments:\n\n(3) Every machine has questions which it cannot answer, but those questions vary from machine to machine. How can we guess which questions the machine doesn't know to provide it is not human?\n\n(6) Machines can learn if programmed to learn by modifying their own instruction storage.\n\n(7) Turing concedes that this is true, but unlikely to impede the machine from playing the game competitively.\n\n# Noteworthy Ideas\n- Turing is funny #qq get quotes.\n\n- Turing stresses that we use discrete machines only for convenience here, and also use electronic machines for convenience. Any machine is theoretically valid here.\n\n- Most of the paper anticipates moronic counter-arguments. Likely these arguments were not so moronic in 1950.\n\n# Direct Quotes\n","n":0.046}}},{"i":85,"$":{"0":{"v":"How Complex Systems Fail","n":0.5},"1":{"v":"\n\n| Author | Publish Year | Publisher | Accessed | Link |\n| :-------: | :------------:|:------------:|:------:| :---: |\n| [[ppl.richard_cook]] | 1998 | [[ppl.richard_cook]] | Web | https://how.complexsystems.fail/ |\n\n## Full title\n\n# Summary\n\n# Noteworthy Ideas\n\n# Direct Quotes\n","n":0.171}}},{"i":86,"$":{"0":{"v":"Chaos Monkeys","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n\n| Author | Publish Year | Publisher | Accessed | Link |\n| :-------: | :------------:|:------------:|:------:| :---: |\n| [[ppl.agm]] | 2018 | [[pub.harper]] | Audio | [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Chaos-Monkeys-Revised-Edition-audiobook/dp/B07DFN12XC/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=chaos+monkeys&qid=1650241322&s=audible&sprefix=chaos+%2Caudible%2C187&sr=1-1) |\n\n## Full title\nChaos Monkeys - Revised Edition: Obscene Fortune and Random Failure in Silicon Valley\n\n# Summary\n\n# Noteworthy Ideas\n\n# Direct Quotes\n","n":0.147}}},{"i":87,"$":{"0":{"v":"Pub","n":1}}},{"i":88,"$":{"0":{"v":"Simon & Schuster","n":0.577}}},{"i":89,"$":{"0":{"v":"Random House Audio","n":0.577}}},{"i":90,"$":{"0":{"v":"Norton & Company","n":0.577}}},{"i":91,"$":{"0":{"v":"William Morrow","n":0.707}}},{"i":92,"$":{"0":{"v":"Mind","n":1}}},{"i":93,"$":{"0":{"v":"Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society","n":0.408}}},{"i":94,"$":{"0":{"v":"Johns Hopkins University Press","n":0.5}}},{"i":95,"$":{"0":{"v":"Harper Audio","n":0.707}}},{"i":96,"$":{"0":{"v":"Currency","n":1}}},{"i":97,"$":{"0":{"v":"Blackstone Audio","n":0.707}}},{"i":98,"$":{"0":{"v":"Ppl","n":1}}},{"i":99,"$":{"0":{"v":"John Von Neumann","n":0.577}}},{"i":100,"$":{"0":{"v":"Peter Thiel","n":0.707}}},{"i":101,"$":{"0":{"v":"Stan Ulam","n":0.707}}},{"i":102,"$":{"0":{"v":"Rob Goodman","n":0.707}}},{"i":103,"$":{"0":{"v":"Richard I.
