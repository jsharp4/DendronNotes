## Everything the Light Touches
History of the use of big tech in Africa, overview of the market opportunity in modernizing Africa, and highlights in the aundvertised battle fought globally for market share. 

### Key topics
* Pervasiveness of FB/WhatsApp in African business
* Reluctance of ISPs to integrate in Africa
* Opportunity for satellite internet providers to take over

### Questions to consider
* How is education system in Africa prepared to work with big tech - tech hub in Cape Town?
* How would African governments win/lose?

## Desperados Waiting for a Train
Account of digital and military technology pushing the Old West frontier off the edge of the map past San Francisco, and eventually even from the Southwest in Austin. The old frontier was replaced by the digital, but has to continued to progress geographically. 

### Key topics
* Contrast between civil war and WWI/WWII technology - we see industrial technology taken seriously early 21st century
* Digital frontier was destined to move west when [[ppl.von_neumann]] left Princeton for UCLA.
* Move from SF to Boulder, Austin, and Bozeman
* Still resistance to digital advancement in the U.S. - when will tech take the south?
   * Ole Bubs - find article on fiber internet by Cory Doctorouw

### Objective Wars
Trend of marketed and for-profit science since WWII. Commentary on how science and its products are incorrectly viewed as pure today. Deep dive into the history of programming languages, esp. on how they fight for market share.

### Key ideas
* how Oracle won the marketing war
* Debate on OOP
* IDEs
* Kotlin built on JVM
* Death of C

## Faces in the Clouds
The reality of how big tech treats humans as computers, and employs the same principles applied to cloud computing to managing corporations. Comparison of hardware vs. people-managing techniques, treatment of people as a resource, and the rise of remote work in tech.

## Shaking the Bee Hive
Programmers and computer scientists have little understanding of the world they build, and are unable to produce products without defects. We can't even write simple programs without issue, much less enterprise systems, machine learning, or quantum computing. A "bug" is a clever piece of marketing to mask incompetence. Understating the complex and unweildy nature of the systems built by software engineers may be perilous.

### Key ideas
* Random success of tech as in [[ref.chaos_monkeys]] and the Hardware Lottery (need to cite).
* Complex systems like code reviews, unit/integration/load tests, IDEs, and patches don't keep out defects.
* Complex systems are inherently broken as in [[ref.complex_systems]]
* Disentanglement in machine learning doesn't work.
* Quantum computing is another animal entirely.
* The internet is built for performance - no delivery or security guarantees. The rest of the digital world is the same
* Humans can't track more than three/four variables without losing accuracy (need to cite).

## The Sorcerer, the Sage, and the Site Reliability Engineer
Trends of science fiction predicting technological advancements. Trends of fantasy magic seeking what electrical engineers have created in the modern world. Highlights of goofy computer pioneers such as [[ppl.claude_shannon]], [[ppl.feynman]], [[ppl.von_neumann]], and [[ppl.alan_turing]] taking life by funny angles. Highlights of authors such as H.G. Wells and Edgar Allen Poe being taken seriously for their philosophical commentary on computing.
