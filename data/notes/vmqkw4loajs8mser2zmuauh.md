At high-altitude, saturation of oxyhemoglobin in blood begins to drop ([[body.breathe.vo2max]] drops 1.9% per 1000 ft) for first ~72 hours. 

Then, body starts to produce more oxygen-carrying corpuscules over 2-3 weeks. 

## When to shift altitudes?
Best options:
1. Increase altitude 3 weeks early
2. Increase altitude as late as possible before 

Worst option:
1. Arrive 3-6 days before

## How to train for high-altitude

1. Go to high altitude, hydrate, and carb-load
2. Use an altitude mask
3. Use a [[body.tech.hypoxic_chamber]]

## How to run at high-altitude
1. Slow down during warm-up (~2 minutes/mile initially for distance)
2. 8-10 seconds/mile slower for interval runs at 5000 ft (15-18 seconds at 7000 ft)
