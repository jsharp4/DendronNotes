## Getting Here

1. Cheaper
2. Lower risk of cancellation due to wind.

See [FRS ferry from Tarifa to Tangier Ville](https://www.frs.es/en/plan-your-trip/our-routes/tarifa-tangier-ville). 

* Length: 1-hour trip
* Frequency: Every two hours
* Price: 43.50 euro

#### Tangier Ville vs Tangier Med
[[pl.mar.tangier.med]] is 50km east from Tangier (Tangier Ville). Public transit between to is scarce and complex for tourists. To go to Tangier proper without a vehicle, best to take ferry directly to the city.
