Big ice field, spans most of the middle of the park - difficult mountaineering ([src](https://www.nps.gov/kefj/planyourvisit/mountaineering.htm)). Recommended to be an experienced wilderness skier and crevasse rescue.

Also a day hike on the northmost point. 8.2 miles out and back. Near [[pl.ak.kenai.exit]] (accessible from same road). May have snow through July. #day-hike
