<p><em>Turing's Cathedral</em> is not a book about <a href="/notes/k9rdugpnda1v57dsx2x83vc">Alan Turing</a>. While set in his era, and even intersects with rough location when he visited the United States and met with <a href="/notes/66ui6l00czw5d0iunbzoewn">Claude Shannon</a> to discuss the theory of computing, the book is about his contemporaries at the <a href="/notes/nq52wckhfod6z3wftsbm3mb">Institue for Advanced Study</a> and the computers which were built to instantiate the universal computing machine.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The <a href="/notes/nq52wckhfod6z3wftsbm3mb">Institue for Advanced Study</a> was not originally planned to be at <a href="/notes/zwrovx7nk94ss8ko364k119">Princeton</a>. Princeton leadership lobbied hard for locations nearby the campus, and continued to spend large sums on expansion nearby.
<a class="color-tag" style="--tag-color: #20c073;" href="/notes/o7z7o919o4d2iq3cda5iutp">#qq</a> Who was the leader of Princeton at this time, and who became the leader of IAS?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="/notes/nq52wckhfod6z3wftsbm3mb">Institue for Advanced Study</a> benefitted greatly from German hostility towards Jews near the onset of WWII. Hungarian <a href="/notes/s32sur9ifohtqpcdlhcpata">John Von Neumann</a>, German <a href="/notes/fabqkfnwqk9nsvbglfoqbdd">Albert Einstein</a>, Austrian <a href="/notes/o3qcopwlro7lpkxxpts6qmw">Kurt Godel</a>, and Polish <a href="/notes/gqwxvi2qc100umics6jmcgz">Stan Ulam</a> all fled Europe to make significant contributions to computing in the United States. The <a href="/notes/nq52wckhfod6z3wftsbm3mb">Institue for Advanced Study</a> was willing to jump through hoops, lie about teaching positions (in Godel's case), and invest significant funds to facilitate immigration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/notes/s32sur9ifohtqpcdlhcpata">John Von Neumann</a> was likely the most significant figure to computer engineering in history. He contributed heavily to the designs of the <a href="/notes/o4nbwwnvymwbclhmv49wd30">ENIAC</a>, <a href="/notes/jazbhcm06x7d2bt2hrqido5">EDVAC</a>, <a href="/notes/q3m4ttiyjwcw2kuxdndrxfy">MANIAC</a>, along with applications in meteorology, the atomic bomb, and the <a href="/notes/l8kmm6sb8tkubtu450xar09">Monte Carlo method</a>. He consulted for the U.S. military, at <a href="/notes/tdl30nmief0y91fa4ucu3t2">Los Alamos</a>, <a href="/notes/kwfglrgwodovnlwkrq3yyfo">IBM</a>, <a href="/notes/fmhdj1z7lalf5b1l6v64wyz">RCA</a>, and served as department head at the <a href="/notes/nq52wckhfod6z3wftsbm3mb">Institue for Advanced Study</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/notes/s32sur9ifohtqpcdlhcpata">John Von Neumann</a> was a genius, known for making jumbled ideas of other clear. Also quirky, he frequently bought and totalled Cadillacs, and lost his lisence for speeding (quote: "Because they wouldn't sell me a tank"). He had great interest in <a href="/notes/yyikvcubn96wogox6mckk6k">game theory</a> (which he more or less invented) and gambling.</p>
