<p>Programmers and computer scientists have little understanding of the world they build, and are unable to produce products without defects. We can't even write simple programs without issue, much less enterprise systems, machine learning, or quantum computing. A "bug" is a clever piece of marketing to mask incompetence. Understating the complex and unweildy nature of the systems built by software engineers may be perilous.</p>
