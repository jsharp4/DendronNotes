1. Sit against a wall or chair, or lie all the way down.
2. Place one hand on your upper chest, and the other below your ribcage.
3. Inhale through your nose for about two seconds, paying attention to your breath as it moves through your abdomen, making your stomach rise.
4. Tighten your stomach muscles as you breathe out, exhaling through pursed lips. Keep the hand on your upper chest still. 
5. Repeat for 5-10 minutes, 3-4 times a day.
