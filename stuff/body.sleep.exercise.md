## When to exercise to sleep?

Recommended to exercise at least 90 minutes before bed for most people, or at least 4 hours before for people with trouble sleeping.

In general, morning vs night exercise do not affect sleep cycles (though exercise in the morning is a free way to get sunlight to regulate [[med.melatonin]])
