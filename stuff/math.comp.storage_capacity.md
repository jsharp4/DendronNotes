As described by [[ppl.alan_turing]] in [[ref.computing_machinery_intelligence]], the storage capacity of a system is defined as

$
C_S = log_2(n_{ds})
$

where $n_{ds}$ is the number of distinct discrete states in storage of the machine. 

For example, a machine with one storage block of 1,024 bits has $2^{1024}$ states. Its storage capacity is

$C_S = log_2(2^{1024}) = 1024$, or one Kb.

Storage capacity is additive:

10 of the same 1 Kb storage nodes above yield a total storage capacity of 10 Kb.
