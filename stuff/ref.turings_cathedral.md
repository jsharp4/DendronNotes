# Summary
_Turing's Cathedral_ is not a book about [[ppl.alan_turing]]. While set in his era, and even intersects with rough location when he visited the United States and met with [[ppl.claude_shannon]] to discuss the theory of computing, the book is about his contemporaries at the [[pl.ias]] and the computers which were built to instantiate the universal computing machine.

# Noteworthy Ideas
* The [[pl.ias]] was not originally planned to be at [[pl.princeton]]. Princeton leadership lobbied hard for locations nearby the campus, and continued to spend large sums on expansion nearby.
#qq Who was the leader of Princeton at this time, and who became the leader of IAS?

* The [[pl.ias]] benefitted greatly from German hostility towards Jews near the onset of WWII. Hungarian [[ppl.von_neumann]], German [[ppl.einstein]], Austrian [[ppl.kurt_godel]], and Polish [[ppl.stan_ulam]] all fled Europe to make significant contributions to computing in the United States. The [[pl.ias]] was willing to jump through hoops, lie about teaching positions (in Godel's case), and invest significant funds to facilitate immigration.

* [[ppl.von_neumann]] was likely the most significant figure to computer engineering in history. He contributed heavily to the designs of the [[computers.eniac]], [[computers.edvac]], [[computers.maniac]], along with applications in meteorology, the atomic bomb, and the [[math.monte_carlo]]. He consulted for the U.S. military, at [[pl.los_alamos]], [[companies.IBM]], [[companies.rca]], and served as department head at the [[pl.ias]].

* [[ppl.von_neumann]] was a genius, known for making jumbled ideas of other clear. Also quirky, he frequently bought and totalled Cadillacs, and lost his lisence for speeding (quote: "Because they wouldn't sell me a tank"). He had great interest in [[math.game_theory]] (which he more or less invented) and gambling.
